Programming is a skill that's in high demand these days, and combining it with business knowledge can give you a major edge in today's job market. As someone who has worked in tech and startups, I've seen firsthand how valuable it can be to understand both programming and business principles.

With that in mind, I've put together a list of the top 5 programming books that focus on business and provide a solid foundation for anyone interested in pursuing a career at the intersection of these two fields.
"The Lean Startup" by Eric Ries

When I was first getting into startups, "The Lean Startup" was one of the first books I read. It's not strictly a programming book, but it's essential reading for anyone interested in combining business and technology. The book lays out a methodology for creating successful startups by using iterative development, customer feedback, and rapid prototyping to build products that meet the needs of the market. If you're interested in launching your own tech startup or working for a company that's looking to innovate, "The Lean Startup" is an essential read.
"Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin

As someone who has worked on codebases that were hard to read and maintain, "Clean Code" is a book that's close to my heart. While it's primarily a book about writing better code, it also emphasizes the importance of good software design and how it relates to business success. By following the principles outlined in "Clean Code," you'll be able to create software that's less prone to bugs and easier to change as your business needs evolve. This is a book that every programmer should read, regardless of their experience level.
"The Phoenix Project" by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford

"The Phoenix Project" is a novel that tells the story of a struggling IT department and how they use DevOps principles to turn their fortunes around. As someone who has worked in IT, I found the book to be a relatable and engaging read. While the book is fiction, it's based on real-world experiences and provides valuable insights into how software development and business operations can work together to achieve success. If you're interested in learning more about how programming fits into larger business processes and how it can be used to create value for your organization, "The Phoenix Project" is a great place to start.
"The Pragmatic Programmer" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas

"The Pragmatic Programmer" is a book that I've returned to time and time again throughout my career. In this book, Andrew Hunt and David Thomas provide practical advice on everything from debugging and testing to communication and teamwork. By following the principles outlined in "The Pragmatic Programmer," you'll be able to write better code, work more efficiently with others, and create software that meets the needs of your business. This book is language-agnostic, so you don't need to have experience with any specific programming language to benefit from it.
"Code Complete" by Steve McConnell

As someone who takes pride in writing clean and maintainable code, "Code Complete" is a book that I've found invaluable. In this book, Steve McConnell covers everything from design principles to debugging techniques, with a focus on practical advice that you can apply to real-world projects. While "Code Complete" isn't specifically geared towards business applications, it does provide valuable insights into how programming fits into the larger context of software development and how it can be used to create value for your organization. If you're looking to build a strong foundation in programming, "Code Complete" is an excellent resource.

In conclusion, as someone who has worked in tech and startups, I highly recommend the books on this list to anyone interested in combining programming and business knowledge. These books provide valuable insights into how software development can be used to create value for your organization, as well as practical advice on how to write better code, work more efficiently with others, and create products that meet the needs of the market.

Whether you're looking to launch your own startup, work for an innovative tech company, or simply become a better programmer, these books will give you a solid foundation and help you succeed in the exciting and rapidly evolving world of technology.
