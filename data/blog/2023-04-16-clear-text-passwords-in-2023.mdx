# Clear Text Passwords in 2023

Introduction

Recently, I signed up at a new website, and to my surprise, when I received my welcome email, it contained the password I used to sign up. This sparked my curiosity about the security measures in place on this website and the potential risks involved in such practices. In this article, we will discuss the sign-up process on websites, the dangers of storing passwords in clear text, the importance of password hashing and salting, and the key takeaways from this experience.
Understanding the Sign-up Process

When you sign up on a website, you typically enter at least your email address and your password. To maintain a semblance of security, the password is often hidden from view, replaced by small dots or asterisks. This prevents people physically looking over your shoulder from easily discerning your password. However, this level of security is superficial and provides a false sense of safety.

After entering your details and clicking the sign-up button, your email and password are sent to the backend of the website. This information is transmitted in clear text, meaning that it is easily readable and not encrypted. To secure this transmission, the entire request should be, and often is, encrypted using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), which ensures the data being sent between your browser and the website's server is protected.
The Dangers of Storing Passwords in Clear Text

Storing passwords in clear text presents several risks. When a website stores a password as plain text, it becomes vulnerable to data breaches, insider threats, and other forms of unauthorized access. If a hacker gains access to the website's database, they can easily obtain the stored passwords and use them for malicious purposes, such as identity theft, unauthorized access to other accounts, or selling the information on the dark web. This not only compromises the user's account on the affected website but also puts their other online accounts at risk, particularly if they use the same password across multiple platforms.

Furthermore, sending passwords through email, as in the case of the welcome email I received, exposes the user's information to additional risks. Emails are often not encrypted and can be intercepted or accessed by unauthorized parties, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the user's account.
Password Hashing and Salting: Securing User Information

To mitigate the risks associated with storing passwords in clear text, modern security practices advocate for the use of password hashing and salting. Password hashing is a process that converts a plain text password into a fixed-length string of characters, typically using a cryptographic hash function. This hashed password is what gets stored in the website's database, making it more difficult for attackers to decipher the original password even if they gain access to the hashed data.

However, hashing alone is not enough to ensure password security, as attackers can still use precomputed tables of hash values, known as rainbow tables, to reverse-engineer the original password. This is where password salting comes into play. A salt is a unique, random string of characters that is generated for each user's password. This salt is combined with the password before hashing, creating a unique hash value even for identical passwords. When a user logs in, the salt is retrieved from the database, combined with the entered password, and hashed. If the resulting hash matches the stored hash, the password is considered valid.

Salting passwords significantly increases the complexity of cracking password hashes, as it renders precomputed rainbow tables ineffective and forces attackers to compute hashes for each unique salt, which is a time-consuming process.
Key Takeaways

From this experience, we can gather several crucial lessons:

- The security of your password is not guaranteed by simply hiding it from view when typing. The transmission and storage of your password are equally, if not more, important.
- Storing and transmitting passwords in clear text exposes users to multiple risks, including data breaches, insider threats, and unauthorized access to their accounts. Ensuring that websites use secure methods for password storage and transmission is crucial.
- SSL encryption is a necessary security measure to protect user information during the transmission process. It is essential to verify that the website you are signing up for utilizes SSL encryption to safeguard your data.
- Password hashing and salting are essential techniques to secure user passwords. When choosing a website to sign up for, it is advisable to inquire about or research their security practices to ensure that they use password hashing and salting to protect user information.
- As users, we must remain vigilant and be proactive about our online security. This includes using strong, unique passwords for each account, enabling multi-factor authentication where available, and staying informed about the security practices of the websites and services we use.
- Websites and service providers should be transparent about their security measures and continuously strive to improve their security practices. This not only protects users but also contributes to building trust and fostering a safe online environment.

In conclusion, my experience with receiving my password in a welcome email highlights the critical role that online security plays in today's digital landscape. The potential dangers of storing and transmitting passwords in clear text are immense, and both users and websites must take appropriate measures to ensure that sensitive information is protected. Users need to be aware of the security practices employed by the websites they frequent, while service providers should prioritize implementing robust security measures such as password hashing and salting.

It is essential for users to take responsibility for their own online security. This includes utilizing strong, unique passwords for each account, enabling multi-factor authentication where possible, and staying informed about security best practices. By actively engaging in secure behaviors and understanding the risks associated with poor security practices, users can significantly reduce their exposure to potential threats and better protect their personal information.

At the same time, websites and service providers must strive for transparency and continuous improvement in their security practices. This involves not only implementing advanced security measures like password hashing and salting, but also regularly reviewing and updating these measures to address new and emerging threats. By fostering a culture of security awareness and prioritizing the protection of user information, websites can create a safer online environment for everyone. In the end, ensuring the security and privacy of users' data is a collective effort that requires the commitment of both users and service providers. Together, we can build a more secure and trustworthy online ecosystem for all.
