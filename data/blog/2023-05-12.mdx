Sure, I'd be happy to write a blog post on the topic of "making time" and how many people use the excuse of not having time when in reality, they simply don't prioritize certain activities.

It's a common refrain that we hear all the time: "I don't have time for that." Whether it's exercise, spending time with loved ones, pursuing a hobby, or even just taking a few moments to relax, many people seem to be constantly short on time.

But is it really true that we don't have time for these things, or are we simply not making time for them?

The reality is that we all have the same 24 hours in a day, and how we use that time is largely a matter of choice. Of course, we all have obligations and responsibilities that take up a significant chunk of our time, such as work, school, and caring for family members. But even within those constraints, there are often pockets of time that we could be using more effectively.

For example, how many of us spend hours scrolling through social media or watching TV in the evenings? While there's nothing inherently wrong with those activities, they can easily eat up a significant chunk of our free time that could be better spent on other things.

So why do so many of us default to the excuse of not having enough time? There are a few reasons for this.

Firstly, it's an easy way to avoid doing something that we're not particularly interested in or that we find challenging. Saying "I don't have time for that" lets us off the hook without having to admit that we simply don't want to do it.

Secondly, it's a socially acceptable excuse. We live in a culture that values productivity and busyness, and there's often a sense of shame attached to not being busy enough. Saying "I don't have time for that" can be a way of signaling that we're important and in demand.

But ultimately, using the excuse of not having time can be detrimental to our well-being. When we don't make time for the things that matter to us, we can start to feel unfulfilled, stressed, and disconnected from ourselves and others. It's important to recognize that we have a choice in how we use our time, and that making time for the things that matter to us can have a profound impact on our happiness and sense of purpose.

So how can we make time for the things that matter? Here are a few tips:

    Prioritize. Take a look at your schedule and identify the things that are most important to you. Make a conscious effort to prioritize those activities over less meaningful ones.
    Schedule it in. If something is truly important to you, make it a non-negotiable part of your schedule. Block off time in your calendar and treat it as you would any other appointment.
    Be mindful of how you're using your time. It's easy to get sucked into time-wasting activities without even realizing it. Try keeping a time log for a week or two to identify areas where you could be using your time more effectively.
    Set boundaries. Sometimes we don't make time for the things that matter because we're constantly being pulled in different directions by other people's demands. Learn to say no when necessary, and set boundaries around your time and energy.

By making a conscious effort to prioritize the things that matter to us, we can start to shift our mindset from one of scarcity to one of abundance. Instead of feeling like we don't have enough time, we can start to see that we have more control over our time than we realize. And that can be a powerful realization indeed.
