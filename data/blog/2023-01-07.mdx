HTML is a very forgiving language so you technically don't _need_ any website boilerplate, but it is still very nice to have to make it proper. You don't need to memorize the following boilerplate. To have proper HTML, you would need the following boilerplate.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>title</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

`<!DOCTYPE html>`

Declares that the following document is of the HTML type.
`<html>`

Opens the HTML document.
`<head>`

Opens the `<head>`-part of the document. The `<head>`-part doesn't get showed in the actual HTML-document but it has information for the web browser, like the following tags.
`<meta charset="UTF-8">`

Sets the charset of the document to UTF-8. What does this mean? Effectively this means that international symbols will be displayed properly in the web document. It's telling the web browser that the character set to use is UTF-8, which contains all of the international characters.
`<title>title</title>`

Sets the title in the toolbar to whatever is in between the `<title>` tags.
`</head>`

Closes the `<head>`-tag
`<body>`

Opens the `<body>` which is where all of the actual content is stored. This is what you are going to see when you go to the webpage and this is where you put the `<p>` and `<h1>`-tags
`</body>`

Closes the `</body>`-tag.
`</html>`

Closes the `</html>`-tag

In this blog post, we have covered the basics of creating a proper HTML boilerplate. Having a proper boilerplate is important to ensure that your web pages are structured correctly, and web browsers can understand and display them properly. The provided boilerplate serves as a starting point for building any HTML document.

Moving forward, you can start adding more HTML elements within the `<body>` tag of the boilerplate to create the content of your web page. Some common elements include headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`), images (`<img>`), and links (`<a>`).

Additionally, you can also include CSS and JavaScript within your HTML document to add styling and interactivity, respectively. You can either include these directly within the `<head>` and `<body>` tags or link to external files using the `<link>` and `<script>` tags.

As you continue your journey into web development, you will learn more about these elements, attributes, and best practices to create efficient, accessible, and responsive web pages.
