    description: `Work on the platform started in the spring of 2017 with the launch being later in the fall. During the four months of operations we achieved a revenue growth of 33% month-on-month with a combined revenue of over 1 000 000 SEK and a projected revenue for 2018 of 5 000 000 SEK. Later that year there were new regulatory changes which made the business structure unfeasible. We had to shut down operations 4 months after launch due to regulatory changes and lack of funding.`,
