# Why Do People Recommend Getting Expensive Lenses Instead of Camera Bodies?

When it comes to photography, there is a common saying: "Invest in glass, not bodies." This piece of advice, often echoed by professionals and photography enthusiasts alike, suggests that photographers should prioritize investing in high-quality lenses over expensive camera bodies. But why is this the case? In this blog post, we will delve into the reasons behind this recommendation, exploring the advantages of premium lenses and how they can enhance your photographic endeavors.
Lenses Determine Image Quality

One of the primary reasons to invest in expensive lenses is that they play a significant role in determining image quality. While camera bodies come and go as technology advances, the quality of a lens remains relatively constant. High-quality lenses provide better sharpness, contrast, color rendition, and overall image quality compared to their cheaper counterparts. This is due to several factors, including:

a) Better Glass Quality: Expensive lenses often use superior quality glass, which minimizes distortion and aberrations, leading to clearer and sharper images.

b) Better Coatings: Premium lenses often have advanced lens coatings that reduce glare, ghosting, and other unwanted effects, further improving image quality.

c) Improved Construction: High-quality lenses are typically built with better materials and engineering, which results in fewer imperfections and better performance.
Lenses Affect Depth of Field and Bokeh

Another important aspect of photography is the depth of field, which refers to the range of distance within a photo that appears acceptably sharp. Depth of field is influenced by the lens's aperture, focal length, and the distance between the subject and the camera. Expensive lenses often have wider maximum apertures (smaller f-numbers), which allow photographers to achieve a shallower depth of field and create pleasing background blur (bokeh).

A high-quality lens with a wide aperture can isolate the subject from the background, helping it stand out and creating a professional-looking image. The quality of the bokeh itself can also be influenced by the lens's construction, with premium lenses generally providing smoother, more pleasing bokeh.
Low-Light Performance

Photography often requires capturing images in challenging lighting conditions, such as indoor events or nighttime scenes. Expensive lenses with wide apertures enable photographers to gather more light, allowing for faster shutter speeds and lower ISO settings. This results in less motion blur and noise, which ultimately leads to better image quality.

In addition to their wide apertures, high-quality lenses often have better optical performance in low light conditions. They tend to produce less chromatic aberration, vignetting, and other issues that can compromise image quality in these challenging situations.
Durability and Build Quality

Expensive lenses are typically built to last. They often feature more robust construction, using materials such as metal instead of plastic, and have better weather sealing to protect against moisture and dust. This improved build quality can extend the lifespan of a lens and ensure it remains reliable in various shooting conditions.

While a camera body may become outdated as technology evolves, a well-built lens can last for years, even decades, and continue to provide excellent image quality across multiple camera bodies.
Versatility and Specialization

High-quality lenses can offer greater versatility and specialization, allowing photographers to achieve specific effects or tackle unique challenges. For example, a premium wide-angle lens can help capture stunning landscapes, while a fast telephoto lens is ideal for wildlife or sports photography.

Expensive lenses may also come with additional features, such as image stabilization, which can help reduce camera shake and improve image sharpness. These features can make a significant difference in the final image quality and the overall shooting experience.
Future Compatibility

As technology progresses, camera bodies are often replaced with newer models featuring upgraded sensors, faster processors, and improved functionality. However, the core principles of lens design and performance remain relatively constant. This means that investing in high-quality lenses today is likely to pay off in the long run, as these lenses will still be compatible with future camera bodies.

Many professional photographers have built up a collection of lenses over the years, which they continue to use as they upgrade their camera bodies. This not only saves money in the long run but also ensures that their investment in lenses continues to deliver outstanding results with each new camera body they acquire.
Resale Value

Another reason to invest in expensive lenses is that they often hold their value better than camera bodies. As camera bodies are frequently replaced with newer models, their value depreciates quite quickly. However, lenses, especially those from well-established brands, maintain their value much better over time.

If you decide to sell a lens in the future, you are more likely to recoup a larger percentage of your initial investment than if you were selling a camera body. This makes expensive lenses a smarter long-term investment for photographers who may want to upgrade or change their gear in the future.
Improved Autofocus Performance

High-quality lenses often feature faster and more accurate autofocus systems, which can make a significant difference in capturing sharp, well-focused images. This is particularly important for photographers who shoot fast-moving subjects, such as sports, wildlife, or events.

Expensive lenses typically have better autofocus motors, which are quieter and more efficient, leading to quicker and more precise focusing. This can be a game-changer in situations where capturing the perfect shot depends on split-second timing and razor-sharp focus.
Enhanced Creative Potential

Ultimately, investing in expensive lenses can help photographers unlock their full creative potential. High-quality lenses provide the tools necessary to achieve a wide range of artistic effects, from capturing stunning landscapes with ultra-wide-angle lenses to isolating subjects with beautiful bokeh using fast prime lenses.

By investing in premium lenses, photographers can push the boundaries of their craft, experiment with new techniques, and create images that truly stand out. It's not just about the technical aspects of image quality; it's about the endless creative possibilities that become available when using the best tools for the job.
Conclusion

While camera bodies are undoubtedly important, it's clear that investing in expensive lenses offers numerous advantages for photographers who are serious about their craft. High-quality lenses provide better image quality, enhanced low-light performance, improved durability, and greater versatility, all of which contribute to creating exceptional photographs.

By investing in premium lenses, photographers can ensure they are well-equipped to handle any creative challenge, and future-proof their gear for years to come. In the end, a camera is only as good as the lens that's attached to it, and investing in high-quality glass is a decision that will pay off in both the short and long term.
