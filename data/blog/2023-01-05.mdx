You might not realize it at this point in time. But you have now learned yourself the two most valuable tools in your future profession.

## I understand

If you feel like you have understood everything so far, you probably have! Good job! You are doing very well! I would suggest you to redo the quiz in a week and see if the knowledge has stuck with you.

## I do not understand

If you feel like you have not understood everything so far, you probably haven't, and that is also very fine! Trust your intuition. Go back and read the previous articles a couple more times. Go for a run. Sleep on this knowledge and come back. Once you feel like you understand what you have read, advance to the next module of this course, because we are going to stop learning new concepts in programming and start to apply these concepts to see the power of them.
