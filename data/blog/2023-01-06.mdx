Modern web programming is a field of great debate. Everybody agrees that JavaScript is programming, but there are two other languages you need to familiarize yourself with when heading into Web Development. These are not really programming languages but rather languages for describing the look of something, but they are called programming languages very frequently online and from your perspective there probably isn't a difference between a programming language and these two.

## HTML

HTML or HyperText Markup Language is a _Markup Language_ used to describe the content on a web page. This for example is a paragraph which you define by writing `<p>Text goes here</p>`. P is for paragraph which makes sense and the <> is called a tag, so in total you call it a _paragraph tag_. The first one is called an opening tag and the last one a closing tag. `<p>` - Opening tag `</p>` - Closing tag. These tags are all around you online and if you are using Google Chrome you can right-click and select inspect element, and you will see the tags everywhere.

# This is a header 1 tag

You use a header 1 tag by writing `<h1>Header</h1>`

## This is a header 2 tag

You use a header 2 tag by writing `<h2>Header</h2>`

There are header tags all the way from `h1` to `h6`.

### Remaining tags

We are going to get familiar with the rest of the HTML tags soon. There aren't that many, but it doesn't make any sense to just write each one down without getting a sense of why we are using it.

# CSS

CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a way to style HTML tags. Everything can be styled using CSS and once again if you use Google Chrome you can even see the styling used on each HTML element. To use CSS inside a HTML tag you write `style=""` after the name of the tag. An example of this is the following.

`<p style="color: white">Hello</p>`

This would make the text color of a paragraph white.
